My new React project "TommyChords" is designed as a fun and interactive game that aims to deepen players' understanding and ability to recognize and play guitar chords. The game is intended to be a valuable resource for beginners and intermediate players looking to improve their chord knowledge and develop their skills on the guitar.

With this game, players will be able to learn and practice a wide range of guitar chords, from basic open chords to more advanced barre chords. The game will provide visual representations of the chords, along with audio examples and interactive exercises, allowing players to practice and master each chord.

The game's intuitive and user-friendly interface will make it easy for players to navigate through the different levels and challenges, while keeping them engaged and motivated throughout their learning journey. 

Overall, TommyChords offers a creative and effective way for aspiring guitar players to develop their skills and knowledge, while enjoying the process of learning and playing music.

Special thanks for Tommy, my good old friend, who gave me the idea of this game, and can hopefully help him keep learning and practicing new chords.

Have fun!
